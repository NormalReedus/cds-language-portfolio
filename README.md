# Visual Analytics Portfolio Spring 2021
### Magnus Bendix Borregaard

This repository contains assignment 2, 3, 4, and 5 of my 2021 spring semester Language Analytics portfolio, but not the self-chosen assignment (the self-chosen assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/NormalReedus/cds-language-project "GitHub")).

Every assignment will have its own directory as such:
```bash
.
├── assignment_2
├── assignment_3
├── assignment_4
├── assignment_5
└── README.md <-- you are here
```

Each assignment will have their own virtual environment in their respective project root directories to avoid dependency conflicts.

To run an assignment, you will have to `cd` into the corresponding directory and follow the instructions in the respective `README.MD`, e.g.:
```bash
cd assignment_2 && cat README.MD
```
